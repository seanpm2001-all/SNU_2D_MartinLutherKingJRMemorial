    <reviewbody>I would love to be able to see if I can use this clip for a Veteran Documentary Class, but I have no idea if this is Creative Commons, Public Domain, or any other license. This documentary is not used for any monetary gain, but is used for a Vietnam veteran's life story on how he deals with racism and anti-war protesters. If you could let me know if it is possible for me to use it, that would be amazing! Thank you!</reviewbody>
